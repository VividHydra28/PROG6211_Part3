READ ME
This read me file instructs the user/viewer on how to use this application. Just like task 1, task 2, is a application that calculates the user’s entered expenses; the user’s gross income and the property rent and property related finances. Task 2 has all the functionality of task 1.
Using the lecturer’s feedback on the application, task 2 not only has new functionality but it has improved from the mistakes and bad practises that Task 1 had. The application for task 2 now calculates the finances of paying of monthly vehicle payments over the time period of 5 years. Task 2 also informs the user if their expenses are over 75% of their total gross income. The application will also inform them that the monthly car payment is too expensive.
